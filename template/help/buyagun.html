One of the most common ways to buy a gun is through a registered firearms
dealer. The process typically works like this:
<ol>
	<li>You find a dealer who can sell you the gun you'd like to buy.</li>
	<li>You pay the dealer a deposit.</li> 
	<li>The dealer gives you the serial number of the gun.</li>
	<li>You apply for a firearm certificate.</li>
	<li>The firearm certificate is issued.</li>
	<li>You show the firearm certificate to the dealer and pay the remainder
	of the price.</li>
	<li>The dealer records the sale and gives you the gun.</li>
</ol>
